Starlight Telescope is a **keyboard-first command palette** for navigating your Starlight documentation. Think of it as a quick switcher that lets you jump to any page without reaching for your mouse.

Press `Ctrl+/` (or `Cmd+/` on Mac) from anywhere in your docs, start typing, and instantly find the page you need.

Telescope does **not** replace Starlight's built-in search powered by [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/). Instead, it works alongside it. Use Pagefind for full-text content search, and Telescope for quickly jumping to pages you already know by name.

## Why Use It?

Starlight already includes an integrated search feature. So why add Telescope?

| Feature | Pagefind | Telescope |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Search type** | Full-text content search | Page title/path fuzzy matching |
| **Best for** | Finding content within pages | Jumping to a known page quickly |
| **Typo tolerance** | Exact matching | Fuzzy matching (finds "config" when you type "cnfig") |
| **Recent pages** | No | Yes - tracks your navigation history |
| **Pinned pages** | No | Yes - bookmark frequently used pages |
| **Keyboard UX** | Good | Optimized for keyboard-only navigation |

**Use both together:** Pagefind for "what page mentions X?" and Telescope for "take me to the config page."

## Key Features

- Fuzzy search powered by [Fuse.js](https://www.fusejs.io/) that finds pages even when you mistype,
- Tracks your recently visited pages so you can quickly get back to them,
- Pin pages you use frequently with the Space key,
- Fully keyboard-driven: open with `Ctrl+/`, navigate with arrows, select with Enter,
- Customizable colors to match your site,
- Works with Starlight's i18n, showing pages for your current language.
