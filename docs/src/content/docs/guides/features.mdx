## Fuzzy Search

The plugin uses [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/) for fuzzy matching. Users can find pages with typos or partial queries.

### Ranking

Results are ranked by:
1. Exact title matches
2. Title prefix matches (e.g., "get" → "Getting Started")
3. Word-start matches (e.g., "auth" → "OAuth Authentication")
4. Fuse.js fuzzy score

Matching text is highlighted using `<mark class="telescope__highlight">`.

### Configuration

The `threshold` option (0.0–1.0) controls match strictness. Lower values require closer matches.

- `0.0`: Exact matches only
- `0.3`: Minor typos allowed (default)
- `0.6+`: Lenient matching

Other options include `distance`, `ignoreLocation`, and `keys`. See [Configuration → fuseOptions](/starlight-telescope/configuration/#fuseoptions) for details.

### Performance

For large sites (500+ pages), increase `debounceMs` to 150–200ms and consider setting `ignoreLocation: false`. Defaults work well up to ~1000 pages.

## Pinned Pages

Pinned pages appear at the top of the search modal, above recent pages and search results. They persist across sessions.

### Usage

- **Keyboard:** Navigate to a result, press **Space**
- **Mouse:** Click the bookmark icon

Pinned pages show a filled bookmark icon. Unpinned pages show an outline.

### Storage

Stored in `localStorage` under `telescope_pinnedPages`. Click **Clear** to remove all pins.

### Customization

Change the pin color via config or CSS:

```js
starlightTelescope({
  theme: { pinColor: '#f59e0b' }
})
```

```css
:root {
  --telescope-pin-color: #ec4899;
}
```

## Recent Pages

Pages visited via the search modal are tracked and displayed in a "Recently Visited" section. The modal also has a dedicated "Recent" tab.

### Behavior

- Pages are added when navigating via search modal
- Most recent pages appear first
- History persists across sessions via `localStorage`
- Pages are validated against current site content on load

### Storage

Stored in `localStorage` under `telescope_recentPages`. Click **Clear** to remove all recent pages.

### Configuration

Set `recentPagesCount` to control how many pages are shown (0–20). Set to `0` to disable. See [Configuration → recentPagesCount](/starlight-telescope/configuration/#recentpagescount).

## Locale Behavior

Both pinned and recent pages are locale-aware. Pages saved in English only appear when viewing English docs. See [Internationalization](/starlight-telescope/guides/internationalization/) for details.
