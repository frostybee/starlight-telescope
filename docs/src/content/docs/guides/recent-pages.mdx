## Overview

starlight-telescope automatically tracks pages you visit and displays them for quick access in the search modal.

## How It Works

1. When you navigate to a page via the search modal, it's added to recent history
2. Recent pages appear in a dedicated "Recently Visited" section
3. History is stored in `localStorage` and persists across sessions
4. Pages are validated against current site content on each load

Recent pages appear with the most recently visited at the top.

## Configuration

### Setting the Number of Recent Pages

```js
starlightTelescope({
  recentPagesCount: 10  // Show last 10 pages (default: 5)
})
```

### Disabling Recent Pages

```js
starlightTelescope({
  recentPagesCount: 0  // Disable recent pages tracking
})
```

The valid range is 0-20 pages.

## The Recent Tab

The modal includes a dedicated "Recent" tab that shows only your recently visited pages:

1. Press **Ctrl+/** (or **Cmd+/**) to open the modal
2. Click the **Recent** tab or navigate using keyboard
3. Your recently visited pages are listed in order

This makes it easy to jump back to pages you've been working with.

## Clearing History

Click the **Clear** button next to "Recently Visited" to remove all recent pages from the list.

## Storage Details

Recent pages are stored in `localStorage` under the key `telescope_recentPages`. Each entry includes:

- Page title (captured at visit time)
- Page path
- Description (if available)

Entries are stored in most-recent-first order.

## Multi-Site Behavior

If you use starlight-telescope on multiple Starlight sites that share the same domain (e.g., different documentation versions), recent pages are validated against the current site's content. Pages that don't exist on the current site won't be shown.

## Locale Behavior

Recent pages are locale-aware:
- Pages visited in English only appear in the English locale's recent list
- Switching to French shows only French pages you've visited
- This matches the behavior of pinned pages

See [Internationalization](/guides/internationalization/) for details.

## Edge Cases

- **Deleted pages:** If a recently visited page is removed from documentation, it won't appear in the recent list (validated against current site content).
- **Title changes:** Recent pages store the title at visit time. If a page's title changes, the stored title remains until the page is visited again.
- **URL changes:** If a page's URL changes, the old entry becomes invalid.

## Combining with Pinned Pages

Recent and pinned pages work together:
- **Pinned pages** appear at the very top (user bookmarks)
- **Recent pages** appear below pinned (automatic history)
- **Search results** appear when you type a query

This hierarchy ensures your most important pages are always accessible with minimal typing.
